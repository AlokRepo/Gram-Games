# **App Name**: Bubble Popper

## Core Features:

- Bubble Pop: Tap or click bubbles to pop them and score points.
- Unlock Themes: Progress unlocks various visual themes like Underwater, Space, and Forest.
- Bubble Types: Different bubble types (fast, slow, large, small) appear to vary the gameplay.
- Relaxing Sounds: Calm and gentle sounds accompany the popping, creating a relaxing experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Light, vibrant sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke feelings of calmness and airiness, appropriate for the theme of floating bubbles.
- Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). It shares the blue hue, but sits back and allows the vibrant bubbles to pop.
- A slightly more saturated periwinkle (#9CB4CC). This will make buttons or special bubbles stand out.
- Use a playful, rounded sans-serif font for menu items and scoring.
- Simple, flat icons for themes and menu options.
- Subtle animations for bubble floating and popping effects.
